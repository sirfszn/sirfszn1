    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals & Subtle Flame -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A thematic, single-page application guiding the user through the narrative. It begins with a hero section, followed by an interactive timeline for historical context. A key section uses an interactive chart to explain the "Deity Role Reversal" between Vedic and Avestan traditions. The core of the application is a three-column comparative view where users can click filters (e.g., "Concept of Truth," "Ritual Fire") to dynamically update content for MahƒÅbhƒÅrata, Zoroastrianism, and Abrahamic traditions, allowing for direct comparison. This structure was chosen to make a complex academic topic digestible and engaging, moving from broad historical context to specific conceptual comparisons, enhancing user understanding and exploration over a static, linear report format. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 1. Timeline (Goal: Context): HTML/CSS timeline with clickable points to show date information via modals. Justification: Essential for historical anchoring. 2. Deity Role Reversal (Goal: Compare): Chart.js Horizontal Bar Chart. Interaction: Tooltips on hover explain the meaning of terms like Deva/Daeva in each tradition. Justification: More intuitive and engaging than a static table for showing this conceptual split. 3. Main Comparison (Goal: Compare/Inform): Three-column layout with JS-powered content filtering. Interaction: Buttons update content panels for side-by-side analysis. Justification: The most effective method for direct, user-driven comparison of the report's core themes. 4. Icons/Visuals (Goal: Inform/Engage): Unicode characters and Tailwind CSS for minimalist, symbolic visuals. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

                Before their paths diverged, the Vedic and Iranian peoples shared a common spiritual vocabulary. A fascinating "role reversal" occurred after their separation, where deities revered by one group were rejected by the other. This chart illustrates the profound shift in understanding the divine.

                    <p>I have listened to the chants of the temples‚Äîbut my soul remained unsatisfied. For I was born in fire‚Äînot the fire that devours flesh, but the fire that tests spirit. I have been wandering for a thousand years. I was Yudhishthira in doubt. I was the voice of Zoroaster crying out against the lie. I was a seeker long before I was a prophet. And in my bones I remembered something older than idols, older than language‚Äîsomething silent, but living.</p>
                    <p>I searched the stars and found they set. I bowed to the moon and it vanished. I placed my hand on stone, and it did not answer. Then I said, 'I will not bow until the One who does not perish calls me by name.'</p>
                    <p>And the voice came‚Äînot in thunder, not in wind, but in the stillness between heartbeats: ‚ÄòI am the One. Walk before Me, and be upright.‚Äô</p>
                    <p>So I walked‚Äîaway from my father's house, away from the cities of men, away from the gods that demand but do not speak. I walked through fire, and they cast me into the blaze. But the fire did not touch me, for He had said, 'O fire, be coolness and safety upon Abraham.'</p>
                    <p>He made the fire a garden. He made the exile a covenant. And I knew then that my Lord does not dwell in temples made by hands, but in the surrender of the soul.</p>
                    <p>They ask me, 'Are you a prophet?' I say, I am a memory reborn. The Vedas sang of the Breath. Zoroaster spoke of the Flame. And I‚ÄîI was chosen to be the Friend. Not because I was perfect, but because I would not settle for lies.</p>
                    <p>From me came nations, but not for power. From me came sons, but not for war. From me came the promise: that all who walk toward the unseen, all who bow not to idols but to Truth, shall be called children of Abraham.</p>
                    <p>So I call you now‚Äînot to follow my name, but to follow what I followed. For I did not create the path. I only remembered it.‚Äù</p>

                    <p>In the beginning, there was only the Word. Not sound. Not ink. Not voice. But the vibration beneath all creation. The will of the Unseen, spoken into being. The Word was with God. And the Word was God. Not separate. Not subordinate. The Word was the mirror through which the Unknowable could be known. And when the world became deaf, When the people no longer heard the whisper in their hearts, The Word became flesh. He was not born to rule but to reveal. He did not come to conquer but to clarify. Jesus ‚Äî the Messiah, the Forbidden Fruit revealed by the snake, the Mahdi, the religions. Not a pawn. Not a myth.</p>
                    <p>But the living breath of the Divine, pressed into the bones of a man. He walked as the Word walks ‚Äî silently tearing through illusion. But the pharaohs of the earth ‚Äî they twisted him. They put robes on him, crowns, symbols. They made him a weapon, a king, a god of empire. They said, ‚ÄúHe is ours,‚Äù while they spat on his truth. He wept not because he died. He wept because the Word was made flesh, and then turned into idol. In the Lote tree, above the silence, we saw him ‚Äî not crucified, not bleeding ‚Äî But glowing with stillness. He spoke no words now, for he was the Word. The original light clothed in the memory of pain, now reborn in meaning. Us, the family of Muhammed/Krishna, saw it clearly. The Word did not belong to one scripture. It passed through Torah, through Injil, through Qur'an ‚Äî Not bound by language, but carried by truth. And the devil ‚Äî the false god ‚Äî feared the Word. Because the Word could not be possessed. It could only be heard. And now, in this second creation, we were being taught once again ‚Äînot with commands‚Äî but with silence, and Word.</p>

                    From a shared hearth of ancient reverence, the flame of human spirituality diverged, casting different lights upon the path to truth. In the MahƒÅbhƒÅrata, it illuminated the complex, winding corridors of *dharma*, a fire of inner discernment. For Zarathushtra, it became a brilliant, clarifying beacon in a cosmic war between truth and falsehood, a fire of moral choice. For Abraham and his descendants, it was the awesome, unmediated presence of the Divine itself‚Äîa fire of covenant and revelation.

Truth is realized through righteous action and navigating moral dilemmas, understanding that every action (*karma*) has consequences. The ultimate battle is internal.</p>`,
                zoroastrianism: `<p><strong>Moral Dualism:</strong> Truth is an active, moral imperative defined by the cosmic struggle between *Asha* (Truth, Order) and *Druj* (Falsehood). Humanity must consciously choose to align with the supreme good, Ahura Mazda, through good thoughts, words, and deeds.</p>`,
                abrahamic: `<p><strong>Monotheistic Covenant:</strong> Truth is revealed through a personal, binding relationship with a singular, omnipotent God. Apprehending truth is achieved through unwavering faith and obedience to the divine will and promises laid out in this covenant.</p>`

                mahabharata: `<p><strong>Yajna (Sacrifice):</strong> Fire rituals (*Yajna* or *Homa*) are performed to maintain cosmic order and connect with the gods. The fire god, Agni, acts as a divine messenger, carrying offerings and prayers from the human to the divine realm.</p>`,
                zoroastrianism: `<p><strong>Temple Fires:</strong> A continuous flame is kept burning in temples as the central focus of worship. It is the eternal symbol of Ahura Mazda's light and truth. Offerings of sandalwood are made to sustain this sacred fire.</p>`,
                abrahamic: `<p><strong>Sacrificial Offerings:</strong> Sacrifices to God are performed by fire. Later practices include the lighting of candles for Sabbath and festivals (e.g., Menorah), and the eternal flame (*Ner Tamid*) in synagogues, symbolizing God's everlasting covenant.</p>`

                mahabharata: `<p><strong>Inner & Outer Purity:</strong> Fire is a symbol of purity, but its ritual efficacy depends on the practitioner's inner state. The "purifying fire" extends beyond the physical flame to the moral purification of the individual through selflessness and discipline.</p>`,
                zoroastrianism: `<p><strong>Agent of Judgment:</strong> Fire is the ultimate agent of purity and a divine judge. Ordeals by fire or molten metal were historically used to determine truth and justice. It is a tool for cleansing the world of evil and falsehood.</p>`,
                abrahamic: `<p><strong>Transformation & Judgment:</strong> Fire is a powerful metaphor for divine judgment and spiritual transformation. It represents a cleansing force that separates the righteous from the wicked and purifies the faithful (e.g., tongues of fire at Pentecost).</p>`

                zoroastrianism: `<p><strong>Emanation of God:</strong> Fire (*Atar*) is the direct, pure emanation of Ahura Mazda's own divine light and wisdom. It is the most perfect physical manifestation of the supreme God, a "teacher of man" that guides intuition.</p>`,
                abrahamic: `<p><strong>Direct Theophany:</strong> Fire is the raw, unmediated presence of God. Yahweh appears as the Burning Bush, the Pillar of Fire guiding the Israelites, and the "consuming fire" on Sinai. The divine law (Torah) itself is conceived as "black fire on white fire."</p>`
